# Landing Page Project

Part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course, this is a project where one is required to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

A deployed version of the project can be found [here](https://frosty-fermat-7bf9c8.netlify.app/)
